# 🌿 Preylife: An Evolutionary Ecosystem Simulation

## 🤔 What is this Simulation?

Preylife is a fascinating digital ecosystem that demonstrates the emergence of complex evolutionary strategies through simple probabilistic rules. Unlike traditional simulations with hardcoded behaviors, Preylife creates an environment where creatures can evolve and adapt naturally.

### 🎯 Key Concepts

- **Emergent Behavior**: Complex patterns emerge from simple rules
- **Natural Selection**: Successful traits are passed down through generations
- **Nash Equilibrium**: The system tends to find stable states where different strategies coexist
- **Evolutionary Arms Race**: Continuous adaptation between predators and prey

Think of it as a digital petri dish where we can observe evolution in action! 

## 🧩 Elements of the Simulation

### 🟢 Resources
- **Appearance**: Small green squares
- **Behavior**: Static food sources that regenerate over time
- **Distribution**: Forms natural clusters creating "rich" and "poor" areas
- **Seasonal Blooms**: 
  - Every 90 days
  - Creates dense clusters of high-energy resources
  - 🌱 Primary clusters (2x energy)
  - 🌿 Secondary clusters (1.5x energy)

### 🔵 Prey (Blue Circles)
- **Primary Goal**: Consume resources and survive predators
- **Attributes**:
  - 💪 Strength (Green tint): Movement speed & escape ability
  - 🕵️ Stealth (Blue tint): Predator detection & evasion
  - 🧠 Learnability (Yellow outline): Adaptation speed
  - ⏳ Longevity (Purple glow): Lifespan & efficiency
- **Evolution**:
  - Inherits traits from parents with small mutations
  - Can learn from successful neighbors
  - Adapts to local conditions over generations

### 🔴 Predators (Red Pentagons)
- **Primary Goal**: Hunt prey and maintain energy
- **Attributes**:
  - 💪 Strength (Red tint): Hunting speed & capture success
  - 🕵️ Stealth (Yellow tint): Approach undetected
  - 🧠 Learnability (Yellow outline): Adaptation speed
  - ⏳ Longevity (Purple glow): Lifespan & efficiency
- **Evolution**:
  - Specialized hunting strategies emerge
  - Population self-regulates based on prey availability
  - Can learn successful strategies from others

## ⚖️ Balance and Energy Flow

### 🔄 Energy Cycle
```
Resources → Prey → Predators → Resources
(When creatures die, they decompose into new resources)
```

### 📊 Population Control
- **Resources**:
  - Regenerate slowly during normal times
  - Bloom during seasonal events
  - Decay if no prey exist

- **Prey**:
  - Need 80% energy to reproduce
  - Split energy with offspring
  - Can evolve energy capacity

- **Predators**:
  - Need 70% energy to reproduce
  - Higher energy costs than prey
  - Get 85% of prey's energy when hunting

## 🧬 Evolutionary Strategies

### 🎯 Specialization vs Generalization
- **Specialists**: Excel in one trait (high strength OR high stealth)
  - Better at specific tasks
  - More energy efficient in their specialty
  - Vulnerable to environmental changes

- **Generalists**: Balanced traits
  - More adaptable
  - Less efficient
  - Better survival in varying conditions

### 🔄 Common Adaptations

#### 🔵 Prey Strategies:
- **Speed Demons**: High strength, low stealth
  - Outrun predators
  - Quick resource gathering
- **Ghost Prey**: High stealth, low strength
  - Early predator detection
  - Efficient evasion
- **Adaptive Prey**: High learnability
  - Quick strategy adjustment
  - Social learning

#### 🔴 Predator Strategies:
- **Brute Hunters**: High strength
  - Direct pursuit
  - High capture rate
- **Stealth Hunters**: High stealth
  - Surprise attacks
  - Better approach success
- **Pack Hunters**: High learnability
  - Learn from successful hunters
  - Adapt to prey patterns

## 🎮 Observation Tips

1. 👀 Watch for:
   - Color variations showing specialization
   - Formation of hunting territories
   - Seasonal migration patterns
   - Population boom-bust cycles

2. 🔍 Look for:
   - Prey clustering in safe zones
   - Predator patrol patterns
   - Resource competition
   - Learning behavior spread

3. 📈 Monitor:
   - Population ratios
   - Evolution of traits
   - Energy efficiency
   - Survival strategies

Remember: Every simulation is unique! The beauty of Preylife is watching how different strategies emerge and evolve naturally. 🌟
