Let's simplify and create a higher-level architecture for your predator-prey ecosystem simulation.

## Tech Stack

- **Core**: Three.js for 3D rendering
- **State Management**: Simple custom state management or Redux for more complex state
- **Storage**: LocalStorage/IndexedDB for saving simulation state
- **UI Framework**: HTML/CSS with minimal framework (or lightweight options like Preact)
- **Build System**: Vite (fast and simple for modern web development)
- **Optional**: D3.js for advanced statistics visualization

## High-Level Modules

1. **Simulation Engine**
   - Core logic for simulation updates
   - Manages entity creation, interactions, and lifecycle
   - Controls simulation speed and time steps

2. **Entity System**
   - Handles all entities (prey, predators, resources)
   - Manages genetic traits and their inheritance
   - Tracks entity states (energy, age, etc.)

3. **Behavioral Systems**
   - Movement system (random walking, pursuit, evasion)
   - Interaction system (detection, capture)
   - Energy system (consumption, metabolism)
   - Reproduction system (inheritance, mutation)
   - Learning system (attribute adaptation)

4. **Rendering Layer**
   - Three.js scene setup and management
   - Entity visualization based on attributes
   - Camera and lighting controls
   - Performance optimizations

5. **UI Layer**
   - Simulation controls (play/pause, speed)
   - Statistics dashboard
   - Configuration interface
   - Population and attribute graphs

6. **Storage Manager**
   - Save/load simulation state
   - Configuration persistence
   - Automatic save on tab close

## UI Structure

### 1. Main Simulation View
- Full-screen Three.js canvas showing the ecosystem
- Entities visualized according to their attributes
- Visual indicators for interactions (capture, reproduction)

### 2. Dashboard Overlay
- Semi-transparent overlay in a corner or side panel
- Real-time statistics:
  - Population counts (prey/predator)
  - Birth/death counters
  - Mutation statistics
  - Current generation info
  - Average genetic traits
  - FPS and performance metrics

### 3. Configuration Panel
- Initial setup screen:
  - Starting population settings
  - Mutation rate controls
  - Energy cost adjustments
  - Environment size options
  - Presets for different scenarios
- Accessible during simulation for adjustments

### 4. Control Bar
- Play/pause button
- Speed control slider
- Reset button
- Save/load controls
- Toggle for different visualization modes

## Data Flow

1. **Initialization**:
   - User configures initial settings
   - Simulation engine creates entities based on configuration
   - Rendering system generates visuals

2. **Simulation Loop**:
   - Time system advances the simulation step
   - Entity behaviors are calculated
   - Interactions are processed
   - State is updated
   - Rendering system updates visuals
   - Dashboard updates statistics

3. **Persistence**:
   - Simulation state is periodically saved to local storage
   - Complete state is saved on tab close
   - State is loaded on tab reopen

## Implementation Approach

For a clean implementation, I recommend a modular approach with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Model-View-Controller Pattern**:
   - Model: Simulation state and entity data
   - View: Three.js rendering and UI components
   - Controller: Simulation engine and user input handling

2. **Event-Based Communication**:
   - Components communicate through events rather than direct references
   - Makes it easier to add new features later

3. **Progressive Development**:
   - Start with basic functionality (movement, simple interactions)
   - Add genetic traits and reproduction
   - Implement complex behaviors (learning, aging)
   - Enhance visualization and UI elements

This architecture provides a solid foundation that allows you to start simple and gradually build up to the full complexity of your specification. It's also flexible enough to accommodate additional features as you expand the simulation.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this high-level architecture?
